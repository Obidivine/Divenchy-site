        WNBA star addresses online rumors, chooses to keep relationship private

      <p>
        Caitlin Clark has become one of the most recognizable figures in women’s basketball, drawing
        national attention for her play on the court and her growing influence off it. With that
        visibility has come increased speculation about her personal life — something the WNBA star
        says she prefers to keep private.
      </p>

          Clark shared a glimpse of her engagement ring while reaffirming her desire for privacy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In a recent statement, Clark explained that she has intentionally chosen not to share details
        about her relationship, citing the impact that constant online attention can have on those
        closest to her.
      </p>

      <p class="quote">
        “I love the support and passion from fans,” Clark said. “But my personal life is something
        I want to protect. I don’t want the internet interfering with a relationship that’s important
        to me.”
      </p>

          The WNBA star confirmed she is engaged, while keeping her relationship largely out of the public eye.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Clark’s comments come amid widespread online rumors linking her to various people — claims
        she says are inaccurate and distracting.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “There’s a lot of rumors out there about me dating different people,” Clark said.
        “I want to clear the air by saying that I am officially engaged to my husband, who is a
        firefighter and a chief. That part of my life is private, and I’m happy keeping it that way.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        As her professional journey continues, Clark says her priority remains on the court, while
        maintaining clear boundaries between her public career and her private life.
